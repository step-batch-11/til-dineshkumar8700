# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
  - Shell Scripting! Understood more how I can write programs in shell.
  - Perlin's Noise! A new concept similar to random but even more cool.
- What changed in your understanding?
  - Now I can create cool automated scripts that will save my time.
  - Perlin's noise is useful where I need rate of change less for random things.
- What would you explain differently now?
  - Shell scripting looks hard to hear or see, but they are just like other
    languages provides very easy way to write automated things.
  - Perlin's noise is just a random function built with little more logic to
    give random value dependent on its previous/next value.
