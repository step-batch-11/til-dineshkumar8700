# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What *clicked* today?
  - I learnt clearly about streams more, what is getReader & getWriter
  - I learn that pipeTo streams automatically closes stream and after that no
    one can write anthing to id. It will throw bad resouce id
  - I learnt how to do buffering in transfrom stream where data is coming in
    multiple chunk. How I can collect those together and perform operations

- What changed in your understanding?
  - My fear about streams released.
  - Now I have understood how streams work.
  - I understood how CLI tool (cat, echo, etc) works.
  -

- What would you explain differently now?
  - Streams are nothing just a source of data comes over time, which we can
    process as per our need and give to another stream or destination

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
  - What is releaseLock() is. How does it works

- What would you like to see one more example of?
- What feels fragile in your understanding?

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “Why does X behave differently when Y?”
- “What breaks if I remove Z?”
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- I will evaluate stream related code and guess their ouput
- I will build CLI tool such as grep
