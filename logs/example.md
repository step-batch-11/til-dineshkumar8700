# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
  - Vectors! Never understood them before today!
- What changed in your understanding?
  - I understood that vectors simply represent two or more dimensions of data.
- What would you explain differently now?
  - Vectors are not simply related to physics or 2d spaces. They represent just
    dimensions of data.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

Prompt:

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
  - Rotation is super hard. I have no idea what actually happens when rotation
    occurs.
- What would you like to see one more example of?
  - Simpler rotation examples. Rotation about a specific point.
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
  - Rotation when combined with translation is very confusing. Especially when
    push and pop are involved.

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- Why do I have to translate back to a different point after rotation?
- What is cross product? I understand the process but not the intuition

---

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try.

- A small rotation translation example
- A spaceship with afterburner trails
